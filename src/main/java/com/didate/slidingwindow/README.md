Exercise 1: Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K

Problem Statement: Given an array of integers and an integer k, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size k.

Example:

	•	Input: arr = [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], k = 3
	•	Output: 9 (subarray [5, 1, 3])

Exercise 2: Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters

Problem Statement: Given a string and an integer k, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example:

	•	Input: s = "araaci", k = 2
	•	Output: 4 (substring "araa")

Exercise 3: Smallest Subarray with a Given Sum

Problem Statement: Given an array of integers and a positive integer S, find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to S. Return 0 if no such subarray exists.

Example:

	•	Input: arr = [2, 1, 5, 2, 8], S = 7
	•	Output: 1 (subarray [8])

Exercise 4: Fruits into Baskets

Problem Statement: Given an array representing fruits in a row, where each element is a character representing a type of fruit, find the length of the longest subarray with at most 2 distinct types of fruits.

Example:

	•	Input: fruits = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
	•	Output: 3 (subarray ['C', 'A', 'C'])

Exercise 5: Maximum of All Subarrays of Size K

Problem Statement: Given an array and an integer k, find the maximum element in every contiguous subarray of size k.

Example:

	•	Input: arr = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7], k = 3
	•	Output: [3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]

Exercise 6: Longest Substring with At Most K Repeating Characters

Problem Statement: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k repeating characters.

Example:

	•	Input: s = "aaabb", k = 2
	•	Output: 2 (substring "aa" or "bb")

Exercise 7: Permutation in String

Problem Statement: Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1. In other words, one of the first string’s permutations is the substring of the second string.

Example:

	•	Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
	•	Output: true (substring "ba")

Exercise 8: Longest Subarray with Ones after Replacement

Problem Statement: Given a binary array and an integer k, find the length of the longest contiguous subarray containing only 1s, with at most k 0s replaced by 1s.

Example:

	•	Input: arr = [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], k = 2
	•	Output: 7 (subarray [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1])

Exercise 9: Longest Substring with at Least K Repeating Characters

Problem Statement: Given a string and an integer k, find the length of the longest substring where each character appears at least k times.

Example:

	•	Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
	•	Output: 3 (substring "aaa")

Exercise 10: Longest Subarray with Equal Number of 0s and 1s

Problem Statement: Given a binary array, find the length of the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s.

Example:

	•	Input: arr = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
	•	Output: 6 (subarray [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1])
